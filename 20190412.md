**Summary**

- This post summarizes [IBM's approach](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/03/real-time-sequential-decision-making/) to the [Pommerman Challenge](https://www.pommerman.com/). This method won first and third place in the Pommerman Challenge.
- Pommerman is difficult to tue its large branching factor: there are 4 players and each player can make one of 6 actions, resulting in a branching factor of $6^4=1296$.
- Decision time constraints makes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) infeasible.
- Instead, IBM uses tree search for limited depth to create a small search tree and evaluates its leaves by generating "deterministic" and "pessimistic" scenarios.
- The "deterministic" scenario has no branching factor, so it can be evaluated much faster.
- This relies that the action selected under "pessimistic" scenario is a good action.
- Generated scenarios are evaluated by the "survivability" of the agent in that scenario, and the agent chooses actions that maximize its level of survivability.
- The agent's play improves as the level of pessimism increases against the baseline SimpleAgent.

**Discussion**

- I could not understand the scenario generation and survivability. An extra paragraph or two paired with few images of Pommerman would have greatly helped.
- There is no explanation about how "level of pessimism" is controlled.
- It seems like when "level of pessimism" is at 10, number of ties start to increase. Why was the agent not tested for higher levels?
