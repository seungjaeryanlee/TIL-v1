**Summary**

- When estimating how long a task will take, software developer are really bad at it.
- This is because software developers are good at estimating the median, but not the mean of the task.
- Assuming log-normal distribution, a distribution of median 1 has mean of 1.65.
- When adding multiple tasks, the sum of means of estimates are equal to the mean of sum of estimates. This however is not true for median.
- When adding means, we see that one uncertain task dominates the sum even if it every task has the same estimate.
- The empirical data validates that the estimates indeed follow a log-normal distribution.

**Discussion**

- Are developers actually good at estimating the median? I don't think I ever was.
- Any task that I am uncertain about, I subdivide them until I am fairly certain how long they will take.
